Lab 5: Cross-Validation and the Bootstrap

Cross-validation is a powerful method for estimating model performance, and while it can be applied to any generalized linear model, integrating tools like sklearn and statsmodels in Python may require wrappers due to differences in their APIs. The ISLP package simplifies this process with the sklearn_sm() wrapper, enabling seamless use of sklearnâ€™s cross-validation tools with statsmodels models.

The bootstrap method is another versatile statistical technique used to estimate the accuracy of a statistic, such as the standard error. It is advantageous because it requires no complex calculations and can be applied to a wide range of problems. Although Python offers several bootstrap implementations, writing a custom function for specific data, such as in a dataframe, is often straightforward and effective. Both methods exemplify practical approaches to assessing model performance and estimating statistics in data analysis.
